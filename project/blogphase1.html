    <p class= "title"><strong> Self-Care Is Important </strong></p>
    

    <p>It is very easy to put taking care of yourself on the back burner when you are juggling the stress of your everyday life. I know that I personally have a tough time with making self-care a priority; however, self-care is essential to creating a healthy relationship with yourself. Taking care of yourself is a reasonable goal, it helps you support the people you love and live a happy and healthy life. Unfortunately, self-care has not always been a part of my lifestyle. It was not until we experienced the pandemic and were forced into a lockdown that I realized that in order to take care of the people that I love, I must first take care of myself. Mid-lockdown, I felt myself getting so burnt out from stress that I decided I really needed to make some changes to my lifestyle. </p>
    <p>I know that I am not the only one who struggles with self-care, so I want to share some of the things I have done over the past few months to take better care of myself. Perhaps some of these changes that Iâ€™ve made to my lifestyle are nothing revolutionary or original. Still, I think they are a gentle reminder to prioritize ourselves when we are feeling overwhelmed or burnt out. There are a variety of ways that I practice self-care.</p>

    <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
