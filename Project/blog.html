    <p class= "title"><strong> Self-Care Is Important </strong></p>
    <p>11/4</p>

    <p>It is very easy to put taking care of yourself on the back burner when you are juggling the stress of your everyday life. I know that I personally have a tough time with making self-care a priority; however, self-care is essential to creating a healthy relationship with yourself. Taking care of yourself is a reasonable goal, it helps you support the people you love and live a happy and healthy life. Unfortunately, self-care has not always been a part of my lifestyle. It was not until we experienced the pandemic and were forced into a lockdown that I realized that in order to take care of the people that I love, I must first take care of myself. Mid-lockdown, I felt myself getting so burnt out from stress that I decided I really needed to make some changes to my lifestyle. I know that I am not the only one who struggles with self-care, so I want to share some of the things I have done over the past few months to take better care of myself. Perhaps some of these changes that Iâ€™ve made to my lifestyle are nothing revolutionary or original. Still, I think they are a gentle reminder to prioritize ourselves when we are feeling overwhelmed or burnt out. There are a variety of ways that I practice self-care.</p>
